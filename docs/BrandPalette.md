# Color Palette

TitanUp will have two colour themes. One will be an orange and the other will be blue. It is undecided whether these will be a toggle option for user preference or whether it will be an effect of user progression. 

dark orange = `#E57420`
light orange = `#FF914D`
light yellow = `#FFBD59`

dark blue = `#004AAD`
dark aqua = `#5271FF`
grey-blue = `#446C9E`

# Font Palette

These are Canva specific fonts that might not be availble for use with XCode and Swift. However, these are the styles we are looking to achieve.

Title = `Anton`
Subtitle = `Antonio`
Text = `Canva Sans`
